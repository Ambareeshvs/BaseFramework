C# Api-Client framework template 

This is a .NET Core 6.0 project which helps to understand how to connect API's with client application. This web application contains some CRUD functions for Ads, News and Post.
The Admin user has given all privilages and a commin user has restricted privilages.

The Backend Folder contains the API and it's code and the Frontend Folder contains the client side.

The bak file contains the backup of my database with two users (Admin and common user(Arun)). The credentials for both the users are given below.

```sh

Username: admin@gmail.com
Password: Admin@123

Username: arun@gmail.com
Password: Arun@123

```

Feel free to use your own database values.

Note: Please change the connection string with your's in application.json file to work perfectly.
